Situation/Task: Collaborated with Portage Animal Protective League (non-profit) to analyze highly inconsistent animal welfare and sponsorship datasets (vaccinations, adoptions, sponsors, complaints). Action: Cleaned and standardized messy data (blanks, 0/â€“1 codes, duplicate IDs) using Python (Pandas) and SQL. Modeled data into fact/dimension schema for Power BI, enabling relationship-based reporting (animal records, sponsors, municipalities). Built interactive dashboards visualizing key KPIs: adoption vs. euthanasia rates, vaccination compliance, sponsor churn, and cruelty hot-spots. Result: Delivered a comprehensive dashboard that improved transparency for sponsors and management, helped identify community problem areas (e.g., municipalities with high cat intakes), and supported fundraising with program-based sponsor insights
